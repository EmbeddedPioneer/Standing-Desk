# Standing Desk

## Overview  
The **Standing Desk** is an electrically adjustable desk that allows users to switch between sitting and standing positions effortlessly. Designed for ergonomic comfort and improved posture, this desk integrates a motorized lifting mechanism controlled by a custom PCB and firmware. The repository provides everything needed to build the desk, including laser-cut MDF parts, schematic and PCB design files, and firmware for motor control.

## Features  
- **Electric Height Adjustment**: Smooth transition between sitting and standing positions.  
- **Custom PCB & Firmware**: Efficient motor control for precise height adjustments.  
- **Laser-Cut MDF Parts**: Precision-cut structural components for easy assembly.  
- **Modular & Expandable**: Designed for modifications and upgrades.  

## Repository Contents  
This repository includes:  
- **Laser-Cut MDF Parts**: DXF files for cutting the structural components.  
- **Schematic Design**: Circuit diagrams for the electronics.  
- **PCB Design**: KiCAD PCB files for manufacturing the control board.  
- **Firmware**: Embedded software to control the motor and user interface.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Microcontroller**: Atmega328p microcontroller.  
- **Motor Driver**: L298N motor driver for smooth operation.  
- **Embedded C (Firmware)**: Arduino Platform baased Firmware.  
- **Laser Cutting**: DXF MDF parts for precision assembly.  

## Usage  
- Adjust the height using the control panel.  
- The firmware ensures smooth and safe motor operation.
