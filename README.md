# Standing Desk 

## Overview  
The **Standing Desk** is an electrically adjustable desk designed for ergonomic comfort, allowing users to transition between sitting and standing positions with ease. The desk features a motorized lifting mechanism controlled by a custom PCB and firmware.  

This repository contains all the necessary files to build and assemble the desk, including mechanical parts, electronic schematics, PCB design, and firmware.  

## Features  
- **Electric Height Adjustment** â€“ Smooth motorized movement for seamless transitions between sitting and standing positions.  
- **Memory Presets** â€“ Store preferred height positions for quick adjustments.
- **Button Control** â€“ User-friendly interface for height adjustment.
- **Supports up to 20kg Load** â€“ Sturdy design capable of handling up to **20kg** of weight.

## Hardware Overview  
1. **Inputs**:  
   - **Power Supply**: 12V or 24V (Depends on DC motor model) and GND.  
   - **Control Switches**:  
     - 2 Switches for UP and DOWN.  
     - 1 Switch for Homing To the Min Position .
     - 1 Switch to save the current position. 
     - 1 Switch to select the Mode (Saved Position).
     - 1 Endstop to detects the Min Position when Homing.
     - 1 Optical Endstop to calculate the travel from the Min position to the current position.
2. **Outputs**:  
   - 1 High torque DC motor.
3. **PCB Design**:  
   - Single-layer for easy DIY manufacturing.  
   - THT components for straightforward soldering.  
   - Compact layout with labeled connections.

## Firmware  
The firmware is written on the **Arduino platform** and requires the ATmega328P chip to be bootloaded.  
### Setup:  
1. Burn the **Arduino bootloader** onto the ATmega328P chip.  
2. Open the provided Arduino code in the repository.  
3. Compile and upload the code to the ATmega328P using an **Arduino-compatible programmer**.

## Operation  

### Powering On  
1. Connect the **24V/12V power supply** to the PCB.  
2. Ensure all connections (motors, endstops, buttons) are properly secured.  

### Manual Height Adjustment  
- Use the **UP** and **DOWN** buttons to control the desk height.  
- The **motorized mechanism** moves the desk smoothly between sitting and standing positions.  
- The **optical endstop** continuously tracks position changes to ensure precise height adjustments.  

### Homing Process  
- When first powered on, the system requires **homing** to calibrate its position.  
- Press the **Homing button**, and the desk will move to the **minimum position**.  
- The **mechanical endstop** will detect the lower limit and stop movement.  
- Once homing is complete, the system is ready for normal operation.  

### Memory Presets (Saved Position)  
- The desk allows storing one specific height positions for quick recall.  
- Press the **Mode button** to switch to **Saved Position Mode**.  
- Adjust the desk to a preferred height and **save it** using save button.  
- When  pressing **MODE** the disk will move to the stored positions.  

### Safety Features  
- **Limit Switches:** Prevents movement beyond mechanical constraints.  

### Shutdown Procedure  
- Lower the desk to the minimum position (recommended).  
- Disconnect the **power supply** if the desk wonâ€™t be used for an extended period.
